# Changelog

All notable changes to mariastew are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.26] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- A magnet no longer announces itself as downloaded before it starts downloading. The metadata pass reaches aria2's `Complete` when the *torrent file* arrives, and every reading taken off its byte counters was answering about the wrong download: the row turned green and said "downloaded" beside the torrent's name, filled its bar, showed "0s left", and the completion watch sent Telegram a finished message and swept a directory nothing had been written to. A metadata pass now measures nothing (`Download::display_totals`), so the bar is indeterminate, the size and ETA are absent, and the state stays *finding peers* until the real download exists ([#372](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/372))
- No ETA before the size is known. A resolving magnet moves bytes at a real rate with no total to spend them against, which divided out to "0s left" on a torrent that had not started ([#372](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/372))

## [0.1.25] - 2026-08-08

### Removed

- The "Added" toast, which never went away. `data-on-signal-patch` is one of Datastar's value-returning attributes, so it wraps the last `;`-separated chunk of the expression in `return (…)` — `{ $addStatus = ''; $addMessage = '' }` compiles to `return ($addMessage = '' })`, a syntax error, so the handler that cleared the signal never existed. It is not replaced: the metadata row is on screen from the moment an add is accepted (0.1.24), so the banner promising one "shortly" was covering the row that already proved it ([#350](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/350))

### Fixed

- Closing the add dialog clears `$addStatus` whatever it held. A success was deliberately left set for the toast to keep reading, which made the toast the only thing that ever cleared it — and the dialog closes itself on a success, so an `ok` outliving one attempt shuts the next dialog as soon as any signal moves ([#350](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/350))

## [0.1.24] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- An add interrupted by a restart is picked up again. 0.1.23 claimed this and did not do it: `--bt-load-saved-metadata` resolves a restored magnet off the disk before aria2 answers a single RPC, so it comes back named after its file rather than `[METADATA]…` and the rule that looked for one matched nothing. The two fixes cancelled each other out ([#362](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/362))
- An unfinished add is now recognised by what aria2 holds — paused, with no `select-file` — and reconciled continuously rather than once at startup, so a magnet that resolves long after boot is picked up too. A download somebody paused on purpose already carries a selection, and is left alone ([#362](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/362))
- An adopted add is narrowed in place when its metadata pass is already over, rather than waiting ten minutes for a `followedBy` that will never appear while the download runs unfiltered ([#362](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/362))

### Changed

- aria2 creates the followed download stopped (`--pause-metadata`), so the filter's selection lands before any content is fetched. The add no longer pauses it — that raced with aria2's own stop, fetched the whole torrent meanwhile, and stranded the download outright if the process died in the window ([#362](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/362))

## [0.1.23] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- A restored download resumes from the torrent on disk rather than asking the swarm for metadata it already has, so a deploy no longer leaves rows on "finding peers" over data that is already complete ([#359](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/359))
- An add interrupted by a restart is picked up and finished on startup. It came back paused — that is how aria2 serialises one — with nothing left to start it or to narrow it to the files worth keeping ([#359](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/359))
- An add no longer loses the race with its own pause. aria2 refuses to unpause a group until it has finished stopping, and a single attempt left the download stopped for good ([#359](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/359))
- A restored torrent being re-hashed says "checking files" rather than "downloaded". aria2 counts every piece as complete before it starts checking them, so the state that answered first was the wrong one for the longest wait a deploy has ([#359](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/359))
- The bar and the bytes beside it follow the hash check while one runs, rather than sitting at whatever the download reached ([#359](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/359))

## [0.1.22] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- `web/app.ts` is now typechecked and bundled with rolldown into a content-hashed `assets/app-<hash>.js`, so a deploy's new script can no longer be served from a browser cache still holding the old one ([#340](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/340))
- `mise run mariastew:icons` adds a macro to `templates/icons.html` for any `icons::<name>` a template calls that isn't defined yet, sourced from the `lucide-static` package ([#357](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/357))

## [0.1.21] - 2026-08-08

### Changed

- Ask for the clipboard from a Paste button beside the field, not on every open. Safari's Paste bubble cannot be suppressed, only anchored to the touch that asks for it ([#353](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/353), [#356](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/pull/356))

### Fixed

- Make the add sheet usable on iOS: full width, above the keyboard, sized to its content, and no scroll on a page that fits ([#353](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/353), [#356](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/pull/356))
- Opening the sheet no longer opens the keyboard with it ([#353](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/353), [#356](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/pull/356))
- Stop the "Added" banner flashing up on every page load ([#353](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/353), [#356](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/pull/356))
- Create a folder without pasting a magnet first — the button was validating the add form it happens to sit inside ([#353](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/353), [#356](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/pull/356))

## [0.1.20] - 2026-08-08

### Changed

- "Done" is "Clear" and "Delete download" is "Cancel & delete" — both now say what they do to the list, and a completed download reads "downloaded" rather than "ready" ([#354](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/354))
- Every control that changes something on the server spins and disables itself for its own request, rather than waiting for the next snapshot to show the press landed ([#354](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/354))
- Clearing holds the response open until aria2 has actually let go, and stops the download with `forceRemove` rather than waiting for the swarm to be told. A removal that does not take answers with a status instead of a silent 204 ([#354](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/354))
- Use magnet icon for add button
- Every mutation is now bounded: 10s on any aria2 call, 10s on `mkdir`, and one second of retries on a removal ([#354](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/354))

- One poll for the whole process, and send rows not the list ([#317](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/317), [#323](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/pull/323))

## [0.1.11] - 2026-08-08

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- A selective torrent is finished when its selected files are, not when total_length is ([#282](https://github.com/radiosilence/jaritanet/issues/282))
