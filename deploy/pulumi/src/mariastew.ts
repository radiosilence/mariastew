   * the media library and terminates traffic from the internet out of its
   * confinement to buy a port mapping. This pod reads nothing, mounts nothing
   * and holds no credential, so being unconfined costs nothing.
   *
   * Mappings carry a lease and the router drops them on reboot, so this
   * re-places rather than sets-and-forgets. A failure is logged and retried at
   * the next tick: an expired mapping means outbound-only, which is where
   * everything was before this existed.
